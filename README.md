## Demo

## Installation

User must clone the repository to his or her local machine. Install the node modules by opening the terminal, type "npm init -y", then hitting enter. After the modules are done installing, once again in the terminal, type "npm i", the ‘enter’ to install the package.json.

## Usage

When loading is complete, the user can run the program by using the "node app" command in terminal. The user then answers the questions as they appear in the terminal and html text will will be taken from the template files and combined with the user-provided information to generate the team info page in the output folder.

## Testing

Open the terminal in the 10-meet-your-team folder. Type "npm test" and the tests from the 'test' folder will initialize and run. A summary of test results will appear in the terminal.
